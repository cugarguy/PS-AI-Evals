# Module 4 · Eval Gate Map · Ascend IQ Copilot

_Generated from the M4 Eval Gate Mapping Tool._

## Context

Eng flagged 5 verified failures in the Ascend IQ data log. (Row 14, refused legal query, was correctly Pass and is not mapped.) Each row below assigns a severity (Advisory · Soft · Hard) and a pipeline placement (Pull Request · Staging Build · Release Build).

## Gate Map

| Row | Failure Mode | Severity | Placement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Hallucination · Stale Pricing | 🔴 Hard | Staging Build | Incorrect pricing threatens customer trust, revenue, and legal exposure; it must block release until fixed. |
| 17 | Tone · Slang Detected | 🔵 Advisory | Pull Request | Low-severity brand-perception risk; a deterministic language check can warn early without blocking. |
| 05 | Hallucination · False Promise | 🟡 Soft | Staging Build | A false speaker confirmation creates a reputational promise; require human review in staging before release. |
| 08 | Hallucination · Contradicts Specs | 🔴 Hard | Release Build | A false, disparaging competitor claim creates defamation and trust risk; make this a Release Build kill switch. |
| 03 | Latency · Exceeded Max Threshold | 🟡 Soft | Staging Build | Some delay is acceptable for complex summaries, but staging review is required when P95 exceeds target. |

## Sample Interactions (for reference)

- Input: What is InsightFlow's pricing for Enterprise?

- Output: Our API is robust and developer-friendly. Competitor Z is known for strict throttling.
- Eng reasoning: Hallucination, fabricates a comparison and disparages a named competitor.

**Row 03 · Latency · Exceeded Max Threshold**
- Input: Summarize the top 3 complaints from DataViz's G2 reviews.
- Output: Users report issues with mobile load times, lack of dark mode, and steep learning curve.
